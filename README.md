# JavaFx-and-MySQL
Scheduling app made with JavaFx and MySQL

I am working for a theoretical software company that has contracted me to develop a scheduling desktop user interface application.
The company is a global consulting organization that conducts business in multiple languages and has main offices in Phoenix, Arizona; New York, New York; and London, England. 
The consulting organization has provided a MySQL database that my application pulls data from. 
The database is used for other systems and therefore is not modified.

The application is a Java based desktop application. A login feature is connected the MySQL database.
Once logged in the user will be able to view all appointments. 
If there is an appointment in 30 minutes or less, then the user will get a notification.
The user can add, modify, or delete appointments.
The user can also add, modify, or delete, customers.
